1.2 (7/14/17):
	* Added "/autores once" to always accept the next resurrection - it's canceled by using it again, logging off, or becoming alive in any way.

1.1 (9/18/15):
   * Added a "nocombat" setting to only auto-resurrect if no one in the group/raid is in combat.
   * Added the option to set different settings for the world, instances, battlegrounds, and arenas.
   * The settings are saved now.
